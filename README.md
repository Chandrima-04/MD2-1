# The Microbe Directory v2.0 
*The ultimate microbe database*

Microbes include all unicellular organisms and so are extremely rich and diverse.**The Microbe Directory (TMD)** is a collective research effort to profile and annotate more than 30,000 microbial species that include Bacteria, Archaea, Virus, Fungi, and Algae.

TMD aims to:

>* Provide a curated list of microbes from four kingdoms: Archaea, Bacteria, Virus and Eukarya
>* Compile microbial data from different [databases](#first) into a single one
>* Give a phenotypic and ecologic description of microbial species [features](#second).
>* Make microbial data handy to everyone!

## <a name="first">Databases</a>

* [Global Biodiversity Information Facility- GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) an international network aimed to provide open access to data about all types of life on Earth. 
* [Virus-Host DB](https://www.genome.jp/virushostdb) a database about the relationships between viruses and their hosts.
* [HaloDom](http://halodom.bio.auth.gr) a database for halophilic organisms.
* [The Mycology Collections data Portal- MyCoPortal](http://mycoportal.org/portal/index.php) a network of universities, botanical gardens, museums, and agencies that provide taxonomic, environmental, and specimen-based information of Fungi.
* [BioCyc Database Collection](https://biocyc.org) a collection of Pathway/Genome Databases for Bacteria.
* [ISHAM Barcoding Database](http://its.mycologylab.org) a database for human/animal pathogenic fungal species.
* [FungiDB](https://fungidb.org/fungidb/) an integrated genomic and functional genomic database for Fungi. Includes experimental and environmental isolate sequence data.

## <b name="second">Phenotypic and Ecologic features</b>

Since microbial communities are phenotypic and genetically diverse, microbial features are stipulated by kingdom.

#### Virus
1. Is it an extremophile: a microbe that thrives in physically or geochemically extreme conditions that are detrimental to most life on Earth.
2. If extremophile, which type.
   * Acidophile: Microbes that live in acidic systems with pH -0.06 to 4.0.
   * Alkaliphile:  Microbes capable of survival in alkaline environments with pH 8.5–11 
   * Halophile:  Microbes that thrive in high salt concentrations. 
   * Metallotolerant: Microbes that survive in environments with a high concentration of dissolved heavy metals in solution
   * Barophile: Also called piezophile, are microbes which thrive at high pressures such as deep seas.
   * Psychrophile: Also called cryophiles, are microbes capable of growth in low temperatures, ranging from −20°C to 10°C.
   * Radioresistant: Microbes capable of withstand high levels of ionizing radiation.
   * Thermophile: Mircobes that live at high temperatures between 41°C and 122°C.
   * Xerophile: Microbes that grow and reproduce in conditions with a low availability of water.
   * Hypolith: Organisms that live underneath rocks in cold deserts.
   * Oligotroph: Microbes capable of growth in nutritionally limited environments.
3. Genetic material: Virus have either RNA or DNA as their genetic material
4. Strand: The nucleic acid may be single (*ss*) or double stranded (*ds*).
5. Capsid: The outer layer of a virus that protects the nucleic acid. Virus without capsid are called naked.
6. Capsid symmetry: The way in which the capsid units are arranged.
   * Helical 
   * Icosahedral
   * Complex
7. Is it a pathogen? If yes, which is its host.
   * Human
   * Animal
   * Fungi
   * Plant
   * Bacteria
   * Protozoa

#### Bacteria

1. Gram stain: Used to distinguish and classify bacterial species into two large groups: Gram-positive and Gram-negative. 

#### Bacteria and Archaea

2. Known antimicrobial resistance (AMR): Antimicrobial resistance occurs naturally over time, usually through genetic changes. However, the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials is accelerating this process. Information about microbes with antimicrobial resistance are increasingly relevant.
3. Biofilm forming: Biofilms are multicellular communities held together by a self-produced extracellular matrix.  Biofilms impact humans in many ways as they can form in natural, medical, and industrial settings.
4. Is it a pathogen? If yes, which is its host.
   * Human
   * Animal
   * Fungi
   * Plant
5. Type of metabolisms:  the nutrition mode of microbes according to the sources of energy and carbon needed for living, growth and reproduction. All sorts of combinations may exist in nature.
   * Primary source of energy:
     * Phototrophs: Light is absorbed in photo receptors and transformed into chemical energy
     * Chemotrophs: Bond energy is released from a chemical compound.
   * Primary sources of reducing equivalents:
     * Organotrophs: Organic compounds are used as electron donor.
     * Lithotrophs: Inorganic compounds are used as electron donor.
   * Primary sources of carbon:
     * Heterotrophs: Organic compounds are metabolized to get carbon for growth and development.
     * Autotrophs: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is used as source of carbon.

#### Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya

6. Is it an extremophile: a microbe that thrives in physically or geochemically extreme conditions that are detrimental to most life on Earth.
7. If extremophile, which type.
   * Acidophile: Microbes that live in acidic systems with pH -0.06 to 4.0.
   * Alkaliphile:  Microbes capable of survival in alkaline environments with pH 8.5–11 
   * Halophile:  Microbes that thrive in high salt concentrations.
